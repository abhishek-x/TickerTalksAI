# TickerTalksAI

With the overwhelming amount of data and news that can impact stock prices, it became imperative to create a tool that could assist both investors in making informed decisions. 
An ideal solution would democratize access to sophisticated stock analysis, allowing users to leverage advanced technologies to keep pace with the professionals.

`TickerTalksAI` fills this gap by utilising the powerful GPT-4 Language Model from OpenAI as its backbone, which not only summarizes financial data but also analyzes 
recent news to provide a comprehensive stock outlook.
